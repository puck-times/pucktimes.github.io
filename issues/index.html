              <p> WELCOME! The Puck Times is an e-mail news brief for Sharks fans that gives you everything you need to know on game night. We know life is busy and time is scarce, so we scan the news and synthesize it for you, every morning before the puck drops. 82 games is a long season, so we want to make it effortless to stay fully informed about your favorite team. Behind the scenes, we are two brothers who grew up in the 90s watching and loving the Sharks - one writer, one web developer. We are just getting started with this project and appreciate any feedback, so feel free to contact us and share your thoughts....  </p>
