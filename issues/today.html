      <h2> WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW </h2>
        <p> <u> Game details</u>: Sharks vs. Anaheim @ SAP Center, puck drops at 730pm.
        </p>
        <p> The Sharks opened up the season Wednesday by beating the archival Los Angeles Kings in dominating fashion. Sometimes a 5-1 score doesn’t truly reflect the way the game went (think multiple empty net goals in a playoff game), but this wasn’t one of those cases. More details on the opening night win can be found further below.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <p> Game 2 vs the Ducks tonight is the Sharks home opener. San Jose as the home team gets the last change, and so how new coach Peter DeBoer decides to play the matchups in this contest will be something to watch. Over most of their careers Anaheim Ducks star forwards Ryan Getzlaf and Corey Perry have played on the same line. Going into the season, however, Ducks head coach Bruce Boudreau has decided to split the two apart.The idea is for a more balanced attack, but with the Sharks having added Paul Martin to their second defensive pair, the more balanced attack might be easier for San Jose to defend. Somewhat surprisingly Saturday’s game will actually be Anaheim’s first game of the season even though there have been three days worth of games already completed on the NHL schedule.
        </p>
      <hr />
      <p> We would be remiss here at The Puck Times if we didn’t mention the San Jose Barracuda played their season opener at the SAP center on Friday night. The Barracuda are San Jose’s brand new minor league AHL affiliate. The Sharks franchise moved their top minor league squad to the Bay Area this year in large part to make it easier to call up and send players down, rather than dealing with last-minute cross-country flights to Worcester, Massachusetts. Unfortunately, the Barracuda lost their home opener by a score of 4-2 to the visiting Rockford Icehogs, an affiliate of the Chicago Blackhawks. A few notable names on the Barracuda roster worth keeping an eye on include forwards Nikolay Goldobin, Melker Karlsson and Nikita Jevpalovs, as well as defenseman Mirco Mueller.

      <h2> IN CASE YOU MISSED IT: RECAP - Sharks Beat LA 5-1 </h2>
        <p> Some of the big takeaways from the opening night victory in Los Angeles were the power play and penalty kill. Now we all know the Sharks’ top unit has always been deadly, but it is a great sign to see the second unit get on the board with Tomas Hertl’s re-direct of a Marc-Edouard Vlasic point shot. As for the penalty kill (a sore spot last season), the 6-for-6 effort, which included a 5-on-3 disadvantage, proved (through at least one game) to be much tougher for the opponents to play against. There was not nearly as much time and space given to the Kings’ top players to operate.
        </p>
        <p> Joe Thornton shot the puck? Yes he did. As great as the future Hall of Famer is, well, almost everyone wishes he would shoot a bit more often. Thornton led a 3-on-1 rush in the first period and beat Jonathan Quick with a perfectly placed wrist shot on the blocker side. Every now and then, Thornton has to mix up the shot since everyone expects a fancy pass.
        </p>
        <p> While the Sharks scored five goals in the opener, the more impressive part of the game was the fact they allowed only one goal. After Martin Jones got beat by a nice tip within the first two minutes, the Sharks clamped down after that. It was a strong team effort for 60 minutes holding the Kings to just 20 shots on goal. The top two defense pairs were phenomenal and Jones made a couple of high quality stops out of his 19 saves.
        </p>
        <p> As is typically the case when the Sharks and Kings meet, there was plenty of hard hitting to go around. Dustin Brown took a questionable charge at Logan Couture in the first period. Later in the third, Couture returned the punishment to Milan Lucic with a bruising hip check.
        <br> <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">here&#39;s another look at Brown on Couture (real time slowed down so we can get a better look at it)...yikes <a href="http://t.co/DVfViC6YXS">pic.twitter.com/DVfViC6YXS</a></p>&mdash; Stephanie (@myregularface) <a href="https://twitter.com/myregularface/status/651964515324665860">October 8, 2015</a></blockquote>

        <hr />
        <p>Finally, Rookie winger Joonas Donskoi got credit for his first career goal on the fifth and final tally of the night against LA. Joe Pavelski’s wide open shot went off the crossbar and then bounced off Donskoi’s pants and into the net. Not the prettiest first-career goal we’ve ever seen, but Joonas will take it.

      <h2> TONIGHT&#8217;S MATCHUP </h2>
        <p> The Ducks have a number of new faces in their lineup this season. At forward they brought in Carl Hagelin in a trade with the Rangers and they signed veteran free agents Chris Stewart and Mike Santorelli. Defensively they traded for Vancouver defenseman Kevin Bieksa and also acquired goaltender Anton Khudobin from Carolina. Offensively the Ducks are scary but Bieksa is a shell of his former self, and if you ask me, Anaheim’s best goaltender John Gibson is playing in the AHL to start the season. So as per usual, scoring against the Ducks certainly won’t be difficult.
      <p> The Ducks likely starting forward lines will be:

    <h2> REMEMBERING MAGIC MOMENTS </h2>
      <p>For this morning's skate down memory lane, we pulled up what we think most would agree is one of the best hits in Sharks - Ducks history: Douglas Murray cleanly levels Kyle ChipChurra in an early 2010 matchup.
