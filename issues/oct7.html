      <h2>  WELCOME! </h2>
        <p> The Puck Times is an e-mail news brief for Sharks fans that gives you everything you need to know on game night. We know life is busy and time is scarce, so we scan the news and synthesize it for you, every morning before the puck drops. 82 games is a long season, so we want to make it effortless to stay fully informed about your favorite team. Behind the scenes, we are two brothers who grew up in the 90s watching and loving the Sharks - one writer, one web developer. We are just getting started with this project and appreciate any feedback, so feel free to contact us and share your thoughts. We know each of you are Sharks fans to various degrees, and so we promise to only spam this list once.

      <h2> WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW </h2>
        <p> Game details: Sharks @ L.A. Kings tonight for the season opener - puck drops at 730pm, with national coverage on the NBC Sports Network.
        </p>

        <p> With the preseason concluded, new head coach Peter DeBoer on Monday named Joe Pavelski as the Sharks captain. The decision puts to rest last season’s oft-criticized leadership ambiguity following former coach Todd McLellan’s decision to pull the &#8220;C&#8221; from Joe Thornton, without naming a replacement. DeBoer has now entrusted Pavelski to officially wear the leadership letter as the team’s ninth full-time captain in franchise history. Joe Thornton and Logan Couture were named alternates, and Thornton gave every indication he is in full support of the decision and ready to move on from last season’s captaincy distractions. &#8220;We all think Pav is our leader anyways so really nothing changes, but now it’s official that he’s the captain. It’s great for him and it’s well deserved,&#8221; said Thornton.
        </p>
        <p> Also announced Monday, the NHL handed down the longest suspension in NHL history to Sharks forward Raffi Torres for an illegal hit to the head against Anaheim&#8217;s Jakob Silfverberg in the preseason finale this past Saturday. After missing most of the past two seasons due to knee injuries, the feisty and notorious Torres was suspended for 41 games, and so will miss the entire first half of the season and forfeit nearly $500K in salary. Is Torres being excessively punished for his reputation? Probably. Was it an illegal and dangerous hit, worthy of suspension? Most definitely. Watch the video here to decide for yourself if you think the punishment fits the crime.

      <h2> IN CASE YOU MISSED IT: OFF-SEASON RECAP </h2>
        <p> 3-on-3 Overtime is here - Earlier this summer the NHL Board of Governors approved an overhaul of the shootout and overtime format. In order to discourage games being decided by shootout, teams tied after regulation will now play 5-minutes of sudden-death overtime with both sides putting 3 skaters on the ice. Based on a similar format used in the AHL last year, the NHL expects the new rules to dramatically open up space on the ice and facilitate more overtime scoring and excitement. If teams remain tied after 5-minutes, a standard shootout will still commence.
        </p>
        <p> After missing the playoffs for the first time in 10 years, the Sharks said goodbye to head coach Todd McLellan (now with the Edmonton Oilers) and replaced him with Peter DeBoer, former head coach of New Jersey, where he led the Devils to the Stanley Cup Final in 2012.
        </p>
        <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Couture hit on Lucic <a href="http://t.co/8k8c1GxaSk">pic.twitter.com/8k8c1GxaSk</a></p>&mdash; Stephanie (@myregularface) <a href="https://twitter.com/myregularface/status/651992773512531968">October 8, 2015</a></blockquote>
        <p> Another big name on the departure list was goalie Antti-Niemi, whom the Sharks traded to Dallas before separately acquiring new no. 1 netminder Martin Jones. The 25-year-old Jones comes highly regarded, but remains relatively untested having only started 29 games in his career. He’ll get the chance opening night to face off against his former team, the LA Kings. Other notable roster deletions from the 2014-15 campaign include 4th-line enforcer John Scott, as well as Adam Burish, Matt Irwin, and Scott Hannan. An additional newcomer to the lineup will be Finnish 23-year-old Joonas Donskoi, who looks to make his first NHL appearance tonight.
        </p>
        <p> In addition to the new coach and netminder, Sharks G.M. Doug Wilson successfully navigated the free agent market this summer with two top-caliber acquisitions. On the first day of free agency, Wilson landed shutdown defensemen Paul Martin from Pittsburgh with a 4-year contract worth $19 million. The 11-year left-handed veteran is known for his penalty kill prowess, and is expected to help shore up a Sharks penalty kill unit that finished 25th last season. Two days later, Wilson signed veteran winger Joel Ward, a 19-goal scorer last season with the Washington Capitals, to a 3-year contract worth $10 million.
      <h2> TONIGHT&#8217;S MATCHUP </h2>
        <p> The Kings enter the season also coming off a down year as well, having missed the playoffs while finishing 9th in the Western Conference last season.
        </p>
        <p> Notable roster changes for Los Angeles this offseason include the addition of playmaker Milan Lucic from Boston, as well as former shark and aging veteran Christian Ehrhoff. The Kings continue to be led by Jonathan Quick between the pipes and premier defenseman Drew Doughty.

    <h2> REMEMBERING MAGIC MOMENTS </h2>
      <p> We like to close each issue of The Puck Times with a quick skate down memory lane. In case you thought the Sharks-Kings rivalry only began with the recent bitter playoff battles, think again. This full ice brawl from 1997 reminds us that the bad blood goes back quite awhile.
