        <h1>Preview: Sharks vs. Capitals </h1>

      <h2> WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW </h2>
        <p> <u> Game details</u>: Sharks @ Washington Capitals, puck drops at 4pm PST.
        </p>
        <p> The Sharks have opened the year with back-to-back wins over division rivals Los Angeles and Anaheim. Joe Pavelski shined with a three point night vs Los Angeles in the opener and Patrick Marleau led the way with a terrific two-goal performance against the Ducks on Saturday. Starting netminder Martin Jones has allowed just one goal through the first two games and is currently sporting a .979 save percentage.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <p> Game 3 tonight is the start of a four-game road trip through the Eastern Conference that concludes with games against the Devils, Rangers and Islanders. Tonight’s matchup with the Capitals pits two hungry teams both known for playoff underachievements. Capitals star Alexander Ovechkin has never been an Eastern Conference final, while the Sharks have never been to the Stanley Cup final. Both teams have been regular season powerhouses over the last decade and tonight’s matchup should be a fun game to watch. The Capitals come into tonight having played just one game so far, beating a Devils team that is expected to be one of the worst teams in the league this season, by a 5-3 final.
        </p>
      <hr />
      <h2> DID YOU KNOW...?</h2>
        <p>Since the 2013-14 season, the NHL schedule has required that teams play every single team in the opposing conference twice, once home and once away. Why you ask? Doesn’t that create much more cross-country travel? Yes, but it also allows every city’s fans the opportunity to see the league’s top talent live in person at least once a year. For example, while no one likes seeing the visiting team score, there’s always a good chance Capitals’ star Alexander Ovechkin will dazzle fans with a highlight reel goal.

        </p>
      <hr />
      <h2> IN CASE YOU MISSED IT: RECAP - Sharks Beat Ducks 2-0 </h2>
        <p> Marleau’s two-goal game was impressive in more ways than one. It wasn’t that he just scored the only goals in the game, but it was how he scored them. The 36-year old was all over the ice, using his patented speed to create chances off the rush. Both goals were scored at even strength, an area where Marleau struggled last season, with just 12 even-strength tallies last year.
          <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="tl" dir="ltr">Teve gol Wrap Around e tudo contra os patos hehehe&#10;Marleau INFINITO HEHEHE&#10;<a href="http://t.co/hRYzctFtbb">http://t.co/hRYzctFtbb</a></p>&mdash; Thiago Jadão (^^^) (@TJP83_) <a href="https://twitter.com/TJP83_/status/653218846644510720">October 11, 2015</a></blockquote>
          <script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
        </p>
        <p> If it weren’t for Marleau’s multi-goal performance, Jones would have been the No. 1 star of the game as he stoned the Ducks time and time again early in the contest when the ice was tilted in Anaheim’s favor. Jones finished with a 27 saves to earn the shutout.
        </p>
        <p> Unlike most Sharks and Ducks games, this was a relatively penalty-free affair with each team getting only one power play opportunity. San Jose’s man advantage went to work after the underrated Barclay Goodrow drew a hooking penalty late in the third. The top unit subsequently went on the ice and were all over the Ducks. While they didn’t score, they impressively held the offensive zone for the entire two minutes.
        </p>
        <p> Shortly before that power play opportunity, the third and fourth lines were buzzing in the offensive zone keeping the Ducks pinned for what felt like another two minutes. Overall, the Sharks outshot Anaheim 17-3 in the third period while protecting a 1-0 lead until Marleau’s insurance marker came with just under five minutes remaining.
        </p>
        <p> Sharks forward Joel Ward returns to the building that he most previously called home. The first year Shark spent the past three seasons with the Capitals.
        </p>
        <hr />
      <h2> TONIGHT&#8217;S MATCHUP </h2>
        <p> The Capitals have a couple of new faces in their lineup this season that should be familiar to Sharks fans. Mr. Game 7 and former Los Angeles Kings forward Justin Williams signed with the Caps as a free agent and picked up two assists in the opener. Washington also traded for long time St. Louis Blues top line winger and American Olympic sensation T. J. Oshie.
        </p>
        <p> Washington’s No. 1 center Nicklas Backstrom is nursing an injury and did not play in the opener. He is expected to miss a few more games before he makes his season debut. Also as of this morning, reports have surfaced that <a href="http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=783000" > Alex Ovechkin will be a game-time decision tonight </a> for the Caps, as he missed the morning skate due to personal decisions, according to the NHL.
</p>
      <p> The Capitals likely starting forward lines will be: <br>
