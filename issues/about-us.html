        <p> <img class="brian-bio" src="../imgs/profile-DBC.jpeg" alt="brian pic" /> Brian hails from Santa Clara, CA and has lived in San Francisco for the last 6 years since graduating college from Dartmouth in 2009. After working for 5+ years as an Analytical Lead and Growth Analyst at Google and Metromile, he decided he could no longer ignore the entrepreneurial itch that is so contagious in San Francisco, and abandoned his daily routine of analyzing and optimizing Adwords campaigns to embark on a 4-month coding bootcamp called Dev Bootcamp. This website is being built and managed mainly as a learning exercise to document Brian's journey.
