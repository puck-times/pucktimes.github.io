            <h1>Preview: Sharks @ New York Islanders </h1>
              <p> October 17th, 2015 - The Sharks are off to a 4-0-0 start but barely snuck out a win last night against a New Jersey Devils squad predicted to be one of the worst teams in the league.

              <p> October 16th, 2015 - The Sharks will unfortunately be without Logan Couture for tonightâ€™s game and the foreseeable future. The No. 2 center was injured in practice on Thursday and had to be helped off the ice by Brenden Dillon and Brent Burns...Sharks head coach Peter DeBoer is making his return to New Jersey where he coached for the previous four seasons from 2011-12 through 2014-15...

            <h1> Preview: Sharks vs. Washington Capitals </h1>
              <p> October 13th, 2015 </p>
              <p> The Sharks have opened the year with back-to-back wins over division rivals Los Angeles and Anaheim. Joe Pavelski shined with a three point night vs Los Angeles in the opener and Patrick Marleau led the way with a terrific two-goal performance against the Ducks on Saturday. Starting netminder Martin Jones has allowed just one goal through the first two games and is currently sporting a .979 save percentage... Game 3 tonight is the start of a four-game road trip through the Eastern Conference that concludes with games against the Devils, Rangers and Islanders.

              <p> WELCOME! The Puck Times is an e-mail news brief for Sharks fans that gives you everything you need to know on game night. We know life is busy and time is scarce, so we scan the news and synthesize it for you, every morning before the puck drops. 82 games is a long season, so we want to make it effortless to stay fully informed about your favorite team. Behind the scenes, we are two brothers who grew up in the 90s watching and loving the Sharks - one writer, one web developer. We are just getting started with this project and appreciate any feedback, so feel free to contact us and share your thoughts....  </p>
